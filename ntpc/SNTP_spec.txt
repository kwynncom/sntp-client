// stratum is bits 8 - 15, or the 2nd byte
// The first 4 bits are the stratum proper; below indicates the number represented by the 4 bits, not bit indexes
// bits numbered in big-endian fashion from 0 starting at the left or most significant end
// The x86 processors use little-endian byte ordering
