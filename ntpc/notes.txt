If the daemon looses internet, the sockets "go bad."  It's probably ok to fail as below and gracefully exit after cleanup.  The next call to 
sntpw will re-start the daemon.  

I should not exit() immediately upon failure.  Several functions should have return values for success or fail - bools, probably.  Then failure 
flows through the cleanup functions.

My "bad write" doesn't have anyplace to go / report.  It should fail.  read() should not fail as easily because UDP packets get lost relatively 
often.

I should not malloc in getAddr.  The struct should have both a human IP and an ip4-6 common ip.
